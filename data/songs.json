How sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found;\nWas blind, but now I see.\n\n'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\nAnd grace my fears relieved;\nHow precious did that grace appear\nThe hour I first believed.\n\nThrough many dangers, toils and snares,\nI have already come;\n'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\nAnd grace will lead me home.\n\nWhen we've been there ten thousand years,\nBright shining as the sun,\nWe've no less days to sing God's praise\nThan when we first begun."

Lord God Almighty!\nAll Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth, and sky, and sea;\nHoly, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!\nGod in three Persons, blessed Trinity!"
